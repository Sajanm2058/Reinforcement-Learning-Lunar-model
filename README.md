# 🌙 Lunar Lander – Deep Q-Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a **Deep Q-Learning agent with Experience Replay** to train an agent to safely land a lunar lander on a designated landing pad, as part of the assignment `C3_W3_A1_Assignment.html`.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Deep Q-Learning**, a reinforcement learning technique, to solve the Lunar Lander problem using OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to land safely by optimizing actions based on the reward feedback from the environment. 

Key techniques include:
- Experience Replay
- Neural Network function approximation
- Action-value (Q-value) optimization

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Deep Q-Learning**: Neural network-based Q-value approximation.
- **Experience Replay**: Stabilizes training by randomly sampling past experiences.
- **OpenAI Gym Integration**: Utilizes the `LunarLander-v2` environment.
- **Visualization**: Embedded video demo of the trained agent’s performance.
